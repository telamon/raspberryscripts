# I don't remember where i got this
# but it seems handy enough to keep for later
# reference. It's an xorg config obviously that lets you
# start xorg in either TFT or HDMI mode

# FBTFT xorg config file
#
# startx -- -layout TFT
# startx -- -layout HDMI
#
# startx
# When -layout is not set, the first is used: TFT

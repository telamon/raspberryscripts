Raspberry scripts
==================

I like to experiment and I have to few SD cards... 

And I very often end up ditching scripts that I write on an raspberry
when ever i want to try flashing another image to the SD card.

So this is an attempt to actually check in the useful things I've come across
in order to quickly being able to clone this repo and push back new changes.

If you find anything useful, then good for you :)
